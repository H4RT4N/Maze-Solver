# Maze-Solver
CS 146 project

Done in collaboration with Connie Huynh

Purpose of this project was to demonstrate the DFS and BFS algorithmns.
A maze solver was chosen because solving a maze can be done using both DFS and BFS and the steps taken while the algorithmns 
try to solve the maze can be tracked and shown.

How to run:
compile all java files
run MazeTester.java
MazeTester.java will output an unsolved maze, a maze solved using DFS, and a maze solved using BFS onto the terminal.
text files containing each maze will also be generated
